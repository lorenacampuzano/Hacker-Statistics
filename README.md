Imagine the following: you're walking up the empire state building to DataCamp HeadQuarters and you're playing a game with a friend.

You throw a die one hundred times.

1. If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down.
2. If it's 3, 4, or 5, you'll go one step up.
3. If you throw a 6, you'll throw the die again and will walk up the resulting number of steps.

Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you admit that you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0.

With all of this in mind, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.
**What is the chance that you will win this bet?**

### In this code I implimented:

- Random number generators with Numpy library.
- Loops
- Matplotlib library
